FASM-DLL-Injector
=================

DLL Injector written in FASM that searches for the process with the window title specified by the command line. Requires the appropriate include file from Theodor-Iulian Ciobanu found on http://flatassembler.net/ 

For ease-of-access I've included a POC DLL written in FASM also.
